# Hey there, I'm Dan!

I've been developing websites since '99, and have been a full-time independent developer since 2007. 

## Here's what I'm up to right now:

- I do a lot of front-end (HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS/React) and Craft CMS work for [Sprokets](https://sprokets.com)
- I am an Org Maintainer for [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io), an developer community that focuses on intimacy and authentic connection
- I am an organizer for [Cleveland React](https://clereact.dev), a React Meetup group based in Cleveland

## Here's where you can find me:

- [danott.dev](https://danott.dev) - my personal site where I try to get some thoughts down when I can
- [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io) - Virtual Coffee meets twice a week for informal "coffee" style hangouts
- [The Virtual Coffee Podcast](https://virtualcoffee.io/podcast) - once a week we sit down with Virtual Coffee members to hear their own stories as developers
